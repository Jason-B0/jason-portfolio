			'description': `
					<p>
						CSCI-2690 is a course that gives us an introduction on software development, and a part of the curriculum is to create some sort of project using technology.  My team and I decided to create a grade calculator website application, where students can input their grades and the website will calculate their final grade for them with various considerations like "lowest-mark dropped".  This was our first introduction to a self-directed website project.<br/><br/>
						The front-end was rendered largely incomplete due to timing constraints, but the backend had been implemented and was able to calculate grades based on the user's input.<br/><br/>
