				2020 to 2023 saw a rise in US-based military roleplay games on ROBLOX, and I was involved in a few of them.  Many of them included some form of "military academy" roleplay games, PVP games, practice games, and many more. <br/><br/>
				Many of these projects were done entirely out of voluntary time, or with virtual compensation.  However, these projects were my first introduction to any level of software development, and thus still very valuable.

					<p>
						This was a solo-project that started during the pandemic lockdown when I was associated with the ROBLOX modern military roleplaying community and had a lot of free time.  Ambitiously, my goal was to try to recreate MCB Camp Pendleton at a 0.5:1 scale on ROBLOX as a solo developer, and thus to provide some sort of open-combat and versatile activity grounds for a USMC-based roleplaying community.<br/><br/>
						The project was completed in April 2021, but ultimately scrapped in December that year due to 1) the lack of foot flow, and 2) technological limitations of ROBLOX in respect to the scale of the map.  However, the concept was well received by the community members, and many kinds of activities were conducted there.<br/><br/>
