						 Our goal was to showcase grassroot soccer leagues outside of Halifax Regional Municipality of Nova Scotia through photography and social media.  With that, I was tasked to photograph soccer activity in those remote regions, and then edit the photos for media use.<br/><br/>
						 Over the summer, I was able to photograph the Amanda Forster Memorial Soccer Tournament in the Valley region, as well as a cup game in the Highland region, capturing and editing a combined count of more than 500 quality photos.

					<p>
						We conducted a census data analysis project to better understand participation of soccer as a sport across Nova Scotia.  As a part of our goal to grow the game, we analyzed various data of the residences in each region, using various data like population density, econmical activity, as well as self-reported data such as average household income, age, and race to better understand the demographics of soccer players in Nova Scotia.<br/><br/>
						Given the Canadian census data for the Atlantics dissemination area, I was tasked to understand the census data, then assist the project by writing a program that filters the dissemination area, and in return providing us the necessary data we were interested in.
