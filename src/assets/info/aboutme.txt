I am Jason, a third-year computer science student at Dalhousie University; a freelance programmer focused on software, game development, and project management; and a passionate soccer match official.
<br/>
<br/>
I've previously been a notable game developer on the ROBLOX platform, specifically within various military-simulation and photorealism projects, and have contributed to more than 5 million player reach across all of my involvements.
Since 2022, with the technical skills I have learned, I built further upon those knowledge to expand into software development, web development, and backend systems outside of ROBLOX.
<br/>
<br/>
In addition to my hardened technical skills, I also excell in management and leadership roles across my past projects, professional experiences, and sports, working with teams across various disciplines, sizes, and backgrounds.
<br/>
<br/>
I am always looking for new opportunities, challenges, and work that adds value to your company, team, or project.  <u><b>Let's work together and get after it.</b></u>
